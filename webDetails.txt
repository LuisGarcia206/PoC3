MySQL Sample Database

We use the classicmodels database as a MySQL sample database to help you work with MySQL quickly and effectively. The classicmodels database is a retailer of scale models of classic cars database. It contains typical business data such as customers, products, sales orders, sales order line items, etc.

We use this sample database in our MySQL tutorials to demonstrate many MySQL features from simple queries to complex stored procedures.
